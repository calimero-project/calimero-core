 * KNX network monitor link.
 * <p>
 * A KNX network monitor is a link to a KNX network to receive KNX bus monitor
 * indications. These indications are provided to users of the monitor link.
 * <p>
 * The link enables transparency of the type of connection protocol used to monitor a KNX
 * network, as well as an abstraction of the particular physical KNX medium used for
 * messaging in the KNX network.
 * <p>
 * A KNX monitor link relies on an underlying intermediate connection technology and
 * protocol (e.g. KNXnet/IP) to access KNX networks, the
 * necessary access options are specified at creation of a dedicated monitor.
 * <p>
 * The name returned by {@link #getName()} is used by a link as name of its log service.
