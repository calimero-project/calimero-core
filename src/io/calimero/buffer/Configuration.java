	 * Returns the buffered network link for the network buffer of this configuration.

	 * A buffered link uses the base network link to access the KNX network, with
	 * additional handling for group read requests before issuing a send: the network
	 * buffer is queried whether it contains a KNX message for the requested KNX group
	 * address. If it does, the buffered message is returned skipping the read request to
	 * the base link (no access to the KNX network is done). Otherwise the read request is
	 * forwarded to the base link, which sends the request to the KNX network.<br>
	 * If possible, the buffered link checks the expiration timeout of a state based
	 * datapoint value using {@link StateDP#getExpirationTimeout()}, and on expired value
	 * requests an update from the KNX network.<br>
	 * So a buffered link utilizes the network buffer as shortcut for group communication
	 * by adding these buffer queries (when thinking in ways of design patterns, the
	 * buffered link would be a decorator object).
	 * <p>
	 * The buffered link behavior might be of advantage when doing process communication.
	 * For frequently queried datapoint states this might save bandwidth on the KNX
	 * network and shorten the response time of the answer.
	 * <p>
	 * Calling close() on the returned buffered link deactivates this configuration and
	 * will also close the base network link.

	 * By default, queries are forwarded to the KNX network whenever necessary, and not
	 * restricted to the network buffer ({@code bufferOnly} defaults to
	 * {@code false}).<br>
	 * Setting this behavior does not influence nor prevent write requests to the KNX
	 * network.<br>
	 * If this option is enabled (queries will get answered from network buffer only), a
	 * {@link KNXTimeoutException} thrown by the invoked method in the buffered network
	 * link indicates that the buffer can not answer the query.
	 * <p>
	 * When issuing a read request from a buffered link, the network buffer is checked at
	 * first, whether an answer to the request is found there. If the query is not
	 * answered successfully from the buffer, the request is passed on to the KNX network.
	 * <p>
	 * A use case where a limitation of queries to the network buffer might be applied, is
	 * when fetching data for a table or a visualization in a graphical user interface. It
	 * usually does not matter, whether some entries are present at the beginning or not.
	 * This will prevent a peak in the KNX network load when reading a big amount of data,
	 * and it will speed up the initialization using already buffered data. Missing, but
	 * required data entries might be explicitly queried on demand by the user.
