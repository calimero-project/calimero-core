 * A limit might be set for the maximum size of the queue. Reading of the queue can be
 * consuming, i.e., a frame and its timestamp is removed after reading the frame. With a
 * maximum queue size set, overwriting of old frames (according to insertion order) can be
 * enabled, to allow storing a new frame when the queue got filled up by removing the
 * oldest frames (i.e., a ring buffer).<br>
