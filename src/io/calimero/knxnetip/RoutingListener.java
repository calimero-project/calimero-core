 * A listener for use with {@link KNXnetIPRouting} connections.

 * Background: a platform's network interface has the option to send multicast
 * datagrams back to the local socket of the sender; setting the socket's loopback mode is
 * only considered as request and does not have to be followed rigorously.<br>
