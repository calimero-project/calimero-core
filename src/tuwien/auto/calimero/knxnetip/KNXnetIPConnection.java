/**
 * Interface for working with KNX networks over an IP network connection.
 * <p>
 * The data exchange (send and receive) is done through {@link CEMI} messages.
 * Asynchronous or incoming events are relayed to the registered event listeners.
 * <p>
 * Point-to-point logical connections:<br>
 * Implementations with connectionless protocols, like UDP, shall provide heartbeat
 * monitoring as defined by the KNX specification to check the connection state.
 * Connection-state messages are sent regularly, every 60 seconds, to the connected
 * server. If the message is not responded to within a timeout of 10 seconds, it is
 * repeated 3 times, and on no response the connection will be terminated.
 * <p>
 * Log information of this connection is provided using a logger in the namespace "calimero.knxnetip" and the name
 * obtained from {@link KNXnetIPConnection#name()}.
