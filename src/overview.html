		Calimero is Open Source.<br>
		Pay attention to the copyright declarations and license agreements.

		<h3>General rules of usage for this API</h3>
		<p>
		No <code>null</code> arguments are allowed, if not explicitly stated 
		otherwise in the documentation of the interface or method declaration.
		This means, applying a method -- which expects arguments of reference type --
		to a <code>null</code> argument will lead to undefined behavior.<br>
		In the absence of other explicit specification in type API comments, 
		instances of types are thread-safe, that is, concurrent access is allowed.
		<p>
		A user application can obtain general information  
		like the current library version, available bundles and similar by using  
		<code>tuwien.auto.calimero.Settings</code>.
