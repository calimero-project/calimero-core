		<p><b>Rules of usage for the Calimero API</b><br><br>
		<b>Null arguments:</b> in general, no <code>null</code> arguments are allowed, if not explicitly stated 
		otherwise in the documentation of the interface or method declaration.
		This means, applying a method -- which expects arguments of reference type --
		to a <code>null</code> argument will lead to undefined behavior.<br>
		<b>Thread-safety:</b> in the absence of other explicit specification in type API comments, 
		instances of types are thread-safe, that is, concurrent access is allowed.<br>
		<b>Library info:</b> general information  
		about the library (info header, version) can be obtained by using  
		<code>io.calimero.Settings</code>.
